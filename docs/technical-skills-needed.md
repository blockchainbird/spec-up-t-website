# Technical skills needed

Spec-Up-T is a specialized tool designed to facilitate the creation, management, and rendering of technical specifications in a streamlined manner. Users who intend to leverage Spec-Up-T for their projects must possess a foundational level of technical knowledge to navigate the installation, configuration, and utilization of this tool effectively. This article delves into the technical prerequisites necessary for a user to operate Spec-Up-T competently.

Not everyone needs all the knowledge described here. Different roles are identified.

*To do: assign the different parts in the text below to the available roles. Also rewrite the text below*

| Skill  | Role |
|----------|-------------|
| 1. Familiarity with Node.js and npm |   Admin          |
| 2. Basic Understanding of File System Navigation and Directory Management | Admin |
| 3. JSON Configuration Files | Content Author, Terminology Author, Curator, Glossary Maintainer |

| 5. Basic Web Development Concepts | – |
| 6. Version Control and Automation | Developer |
| 7. Debugging and Development Tools | Admin |


## 1. Familiarity with Node.js and npm

At the core of Spec-Up-T's installation and operation lies the Node.js environment, coupled with npm (Node Package Manager). Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it a critical tool for server-side and command-line interface (CLI) applications. npm, on the other hand, is a package manager for Node.js that facilitates the installation and management of software packages.

**Required Knowledge:**

- **Installation and Setup:** Users must know how to download and install Node.js, ensuring all relevant dependencies are correctly set up. This includes understanding the importance of checking the necessary checkboxes during installation to ensure a smooth setup process.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Proficiency:** Users should be comfortable using a CLI, as many operations, including installing Spec-Up-T, running npm commands, and managing directories, are executed via terminal commands.
- **Understanding npm Scripts:** Familiarity with npm scripts, such as `npm run install`, `npm run render`, and `npm run dev`, is crucial. These scripts automate various tasks in Spec-Up-T, from installing dependencies to rendering the final HTML output.

## 2. Basic Understanding of File System Navigation and Directory Management

Spec-Up-T users need to navigate through the file system, create and manage directories, and understand relative paths. These tasks are fundamental to setting up and maintaining a Spec-Up-T project.

**Required Knowledge:**

- **Directory Navigation:** Users should know how to move between directories using the command line (`cd` command) and understand the importance of directory structures in project management.
- **File Management:** The creation of new directories, such as the site directory (`my-spec-up-t-website`), and the management of project files like `specs.json`, `spec.md`, and the `docs` directory, are routine tasks that require basic file system knowledge.

## 3. JSON Configuration Files

The `specs.json` file plays a pivotal role in Spec-Up-T, as it contains configuration details that dictate how the tool generates and outputs the specification documents. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

**Required Knowledge:**

- **Editing JSON Files:** Users must be able to open, read, and edit JSON files to customize their Spec-Up-T setup. This includes setting paths, defining titles, adding logos, and configuring output options.
- **Understanding JSON Structure:** A basic understanding of JSON structure—such as key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects—is necessary to modify the `specs.json` file effectively. This knowledge enables users to customize their specifications to fit their project requirements.

## 4. Markdown Language Proficiency

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, often used for creating formatted text using a plain text editor. Spec-Up-T utilizes Markdown files to define the content of the specifications that will be rendered into HTML.

**Required Knowledge:**

- **Markdown Syntax:** Users should be comfortable with Markdown syntax, including headers, lists, links, and code blocks. This proficiency allows them to structure the content of their specifications clearly and concisely.
- **Multi-File Markdown Management:** Spec-Up-T allows users to specify multiple Markdown files to be combined into a single output document. Users need to know how to reference these files in the `specs.json` file using the `markdown_paths` array.

## 5. Basic Web Development Concepts

Since Spec-Up-T ultimately renders HTML files that are intended for web viewing, a foundational understanding of web development is beneficial.

**Required Knowledge:**

- **HTML Basics:** Users should know how HTML works, particularly the role of the `index.html` file as the main entry point for the rendered specifications.
- **HTTP vs. File Protocol:** Understanding the difference between accessing files via the `file:///` protocol (locally) and `http://` protocol (over a web server) is important for viewing and sharing the generated specifications.
- **Browser Usage:** Users should be familiar with opening files in a web browser, either by double-clicking the `index.html` file in a file manager or by navigating to the file via the browser’s menu.

## 6. Version Control and Automation

Spec-Up-T integrates well with version control systems like Git and offers automation capabilities via GitHub Actions. This allows users to automate the rendering and deployment of their specifications.

**Required Knowledge:**

- **Basic Git Operations:** Users should understand how to commit changes, push them to a remote repository, and manage branches within a Git version control system. This is crucial for maintaining a history of changes and collaborating with others.
- **GitHub Actions:** Familiarity with GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tools is beneficial for users who want to automate the rendering process. This knowledge allows users to set up workflows that trigger rendering and deployment automatically upon certain events, such as commits or pull requests.

## 7. Debugging and Development Tools

Spec-Up-T provides different modes for rendering specifications, including a development mode that enables debugging features.

**Required Knowledge:**

- **Using `npm run dev`:** Users should be familiar with development workflows, where the `npm run dev` command allows them to test and debug their specifications before finalizing them.
- **Debugging Techniques:** Basic debugging techniques, such as checking for errors in the terminal output and using browser developer tools to inspect rendered HTML, can be very helpful in troubleshooting issues with the specification files.

## Conclusion

Operating Spec-Up-T effectively requires a blend of technical skills across several domains, including Node.js and npm, file system management, JSON configuration, Markdown proficiency, basic web development, version control, and debugging. Users who possess a solid understanding of these areas will find themselves well-equipped to leverage Spec-Up-T to its full potential, creating robust and well-structured technical specifications for their projects. By mastering these skills, users can ensure that their specifications are not only technically accurate but also professionally presented and easily accessible.
