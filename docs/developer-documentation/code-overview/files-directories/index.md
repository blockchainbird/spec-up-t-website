# Files & Directories overview

Overview of Files & Directories in the Spec-Up-T package and the Spec-Up-T Starterpack package.

There are two relevant repositories:
- the **starterpack** [repository](https://github.com/trustoverip/spec-up-t-starter-pack) / npm package, this is used via `npx create-spec-up-t` to get started:
  - initialize Git
  - adding a simple `package.json`, which has the sole purpose of installing the `spec-up-t` npm package
- the **Spec-Up-T** [repository](https://github.com/trustoverip/spec-up-t) / npm package that provides the operation of the Spec-Up-T tool.
