# Intro

This page is the developer's guide for the Spec-Up-T system.

The `Spec-Up-T` tool is written in `JavaScript,` client-side, and `Node.js` (server-side).

When we say “server-side,” in this context, we mean that it takes place in the Command Line of a user's computer, where the `index.html` is generated through Node.js scripts.

After that, the `index.html` can be placed anywhere on a Web server, but GitHub Pages are preferable because they allow you to take advantage of GitHub's power. The fact that it is an html file means that there are minimal hosting requirements.
