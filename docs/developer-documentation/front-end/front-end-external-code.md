# External code, libraries etc

The external code, like front-end libraries (plugins, packages, or whatever you want to call them) are not loaded via npm but stored as local files and incorporated into the index.html:

- chart.js / chart.css
- notyf.js / notyf.css
- prism.js / prism.css
- mermaid.js
- popper.js
- tippy.js
