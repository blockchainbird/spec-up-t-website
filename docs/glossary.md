# Glossary

This is a glossary with some terms that you need to know in order to understand working with Spec-Up-T.

This glossary was not created in Spec-Up-T, it could have been, but to avoid confusion we did not.

## The Specification

When we talk about **The Specification** here, we mean the result of our efforts, located in an `index.html` file. We call this The Specification.

## xref

Stands for *external reference*. An essential feature for creating connections between glossaries.

## Git and Github

GitHub is a web-based platform used primarily for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to host, manage, and track changes to their code using Git, a distributed version control system.

GitHub provides a user-friendly interface for working with Git, enabling developers to collaborate on projects, review each other's code, manage tasks, and deploy software. In addition to hosting code repositories, GitHub also offers features like issue tracking, project management tools, and integration with other development services, making it a central hub for many software development workflows.


## Github Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows developers to automate workflows directly within their GitHub repositories. With GitHub Actions, you can create custom workflows that are triggered by specific events, such as pushing code, creating pull requests, or opening issues. These workflows can include steps for building, testing, and deploying code, among other tasks.

GitHub Actions uses YAML files to define workflows, making it flexible and customizable. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub, allowing developers to automate a wide range of tasks related to their software development process, improving efficiency and ensuring that code changes are automatically tested and deployed in a consistent manner.
