## Updating the Demo Site

This `index.html` file was generated from [the Spec-Up-T demonstration installation found on GitHub](https://github.com/blockchainbird/spec-up-t-demo-on-documentation-website).

To update the demo, generate the `index.html` and copy it to `/static/spec-up-t-demo/docs/` (see [repo of this website](https://github.com/blockchainbird/spec-up-t-website)).
