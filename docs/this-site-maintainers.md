## Updating the Demo Site

The [demo page](spec-up-t-demo-site.mdx) contains an example of a Spec-Up-T installation in an iFrame. This `index.html` file is in `/static/spec-up-t-demo/docs/`.

This `index.html` file is a standard Spec-Up-T installation, as described in the [admin section](various-roles/admins-guide/admins-guide.md#installation).

This `index.html` file is located in the GitHub repository of this site (the site you are now reading). The Spec-Up-T installation that generated the index file is not stored in any repository since it is a standard installation. You can install and generate it anywhere on your computer, then copy the index file to `/static/spec-up-t-demo/docs/`.
