# Intro

There are two ways to get started with Spec-Up-T:

- Web-based: create and use a Spec-Up-T installation via GitHub in your browser
- Local installation: create and use a Spec-Up-T installation via your command line

## Web-based

The advantage is that it's more straightforward, but it's all slower. For example, retrieving the external credentials is quite simple. However, it does start what is called a “Runner”: a new installation is created on GitHub's servers, and that takes several minutes. After that, the code that retrieves the external credentials is executed. This whole process will take minutes.

On the other hand, modifying a definition is fast: you can use the GitHub web editor.

## Local installation

You can use Spec-Up-T locally, that is, on your computer. It requires basic knowledge of the command line.

First, you install Spec-Up-T via `npx`. After that, you start up a menu via a typed command, and from there, you can enter options.
