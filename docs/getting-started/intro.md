# Introduction

Spec-Up-T offers two primary methods for getting started:

- **Web-based:** Set up and use Spec-Up-T directly in your browser via GitHub (leveraging GitHub Actions).
- **Local installation:** Install and operate Spec-Up-T on your local machine using the command line.

## Web-based

The web-based approach is straightforward and user-friendly, making it ideal for those seeking a quick setup. For example, retrieving external credentials is a simple process. However, this method initiates a “Runner” on GitHub’s servers, which can take several minutes to provision and execute the necessary code. As a result, the overall process may be slower compared to local installation.

On the positive side, editing definitions is efficient and can be accomplished directly through the GitHub web editor.

## Local Installation

Running Spec-Up-T locally provides greater control and faster execution, but requires basic familiarity with the command line. To get started, install Spec-Up-T using `npx`. Once installed, you can launch the interactive menu by entering a command, allowing you to navigate and select various options as needed.
