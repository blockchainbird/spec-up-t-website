# Using Spec-Up-T Web-Based

With Spec-Up-T, you don’t need to install Node.js, Git, or any tools on your computer—everything runs in your browser using GitHub Actions! Whether you’re creating a new specification project or managing an existing one, our workflows let you do it all online. Here’s how it works:

- **Create a New Repository**: Start by running a GitHub Action in the `trustoverip/spec-up-t` repo to generate a fresh Spec-Up-T project repository under your GitHub account—no local setup required.
- **Choose from a Menu**: Once your repo is created, use a web-based menu to run scripts like rendering your specification, generating a PDF, or updating files—all with a few clicks.

No downloads, no command lines—just a GitHub account and a browser. Dive in and start specifying the easy way!
