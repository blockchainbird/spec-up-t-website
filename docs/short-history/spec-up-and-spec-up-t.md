# Spec-Up and Spec-Up-T

## Intro

Spec-Up is a technical specification development tool that enables you to create rich specification documents for standards bodies and engineering projects by writing in an extended version of markdown that features all the bells and whistles - for example: advanced syntax highlighting, notice blocks, complex tables, charts, UML diagrams, and more.

Spec-Up-T is an expansion of [DIF's Spec-Up](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up) specifically for the needs of the Trust-over-IP foundation. Read more in the elaborate motivation in this technical article [Spec-Up-T, the ToIP Terms extension of Spec-Up](https://hackmd.io/s1TEBBluQBSL10ZT5yRVPw)

## Extension

Spec-Up-T stays in sync with Spec-Up, and currently adds the following extra functionality:

1. Search & Find
