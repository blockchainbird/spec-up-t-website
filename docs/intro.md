# Introduction

## Intro

**Spec-Up-T** is a tool that helps you write specifications. It is a tool for writing in Markdown and creates *one* `index.html` file.

- You write your texts in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
- You use an editor (IDE) or you use GitHub's web editor
- Your Markdown-files are converted to one `index.html` file
- The place where your Markdown files and the `index.html` are stored is [GitHub](https://github.com)

The endproduct of your work is **the `index.html` file, the actual specification file.**

This `index.html` file is stand-alone and can be hosted on any web server. Or double-click it, and it will open in a browser.

The Spec-Up-T code itself is available [on Github](https://github.com/blockchainbird/spec-up-t).

## Spec-Up and Spec-Up-<span className="rotate">T</span>

Spec-Up-<span className="rotate">T</span> is based on **Spec-Up**, and some of the content on this website is taken from the [Spec-Up website](https://identity.foundation/spec-up/) and [repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up).
