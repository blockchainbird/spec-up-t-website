# Compare Spec-Up-T Repositories

The [compare-spec-up-t-repos tool](https://github.com/kordwarshuis/compare-spec-up-t-repos/blob/main/README.md) is a local-machine command line tool. People who prepare the comparison of two Spec-Up-T-based glossaries run this tool to see which terms match the two glossaries. The reason why people compare could be:

inventory of shared understanding, scope, or mental model.

```bash
npx compare-spec-up-t-specs
```
