### Reordering Files and Folders

The Spec-Up-T Editor allows you to customize the order in which files and folders appear in your specification. This is useful for organizing content in a logical reading sequence.

#### When Reordering is Available

- **Root Directory Only**: Drag and drop functionality is only available in the root spec directory
- **Visual Indicators**: Look for grip handles (‚ãÆ‚ãÆ) next to file and folder names
- **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically detects when you're in a reorderable directory

#### How to Reorder Items

1. **Locate the Grip Handle**
   - Look for the vertical dots (‚ãÆ‚ãÆ) icon to the left of file and folder names
   - This handle only appears in the root spec directory

2. **Drag to Reorder**
   - Click and hold the grip handle
   - Drag the item to its new position in the list
   - Files and folders can be mixed in any order you prefer

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - The item being dragged becomes semi-transparent
   - You can drop the item at any position in the list

4. **Save Your Changes**
   - After reordering, a "Save Order" button will appear
   - Click this button to save your preferred order
   - The order is saved to your repository's `specs.json` file

#### Understanding the Order System

- **Unified Ordering**: Files and folders share the same ordering system
- **Persistent Storage**: Your custom order is remembered between sessions
- **Automatic Loading**: When you return to the repository, your saved order is restored
- **Special Handling**: The terms directory has special handling in the ordering system

#### Tips for Effective Ordering

1. **Logical Flow**: Arrange files in the order readers should encounter them
2. **Dependencies**: Place foundational documents before those that reference them
3. **Sections**: Group related files together for better organization
4. **Overview First**: Consider placing overview or introduction files at the top

#### Troubleshooting Order Issues

- **No Grip Handles**: Make sure you're in the root spec directory, not a subdirectory
- **Order Not Saving**: Ensure you have write permissions to the repository
- **Order Resets**: Check that the `specs.json` file in your repository is properly configured

   - Yellow warnings won't break functionality but should be addressed
   - They often indicate best practices or potential future issues

3. **Use the Recommendations**
   - Each issue includes specific guidance on how to fix it
   - Follow the provided steps to resolve problems

## Tips and Best Practices

### File Organization

1. **Use Clear File Names**
   - `user-authentication-spec.md` is better than `spec1.md`
   - Include version numbers when appropriate: `api-v2-specification.md`

2. **Organize with Folders**
   - Group related specifications in folders
   - Use consistent naming conventions

3. **Keep Related Files Together**
   - Store images and diagrams near the specifications that use them
   - Consider a `media` or `images` subfolder for each specification

4. **Order Files Logically**
   - Use the drag and drop feature to arrange files in reading order
   - Place foundational documents before dependent ones
   - Consider reader flow: overview ‚Üí details ‚Üí appendices
   - Save your custom order to persist it across sessions

### Writing Effective Specifications

1. **Use Descriptive Commit Messages**
   - "Add authentication requirements section" is better than "Update file"
   - Include context: "Fix typo in section 3.2" vs "Fix typo"

2. **Make Incremental Changes**
   - Save your work frequently
   - Don't make massive changes in a single commit

3. **Use the Preview Mode**
   - Always preview your markdown before saving
   - Check that links work and formatting is correct

### Working with Teams

2. **Communicate Changes**
   - Use descriptive commit messages that others can understand
   - Consider discussing major changes before making them

3. **Regular Health Checks**
   - Run health checks periodically to catch issues early
   - Address warnings before they become errors

### Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Your Token**
   - Never share your Personal Access Token
   - Use tokens with minimal necessary permissions
   - Rotate tokens regularly (every 90 days recommended)

2. **Review Changes**
   - Always review your changes in preview mode
   - Double-check that you're editing the correct file and branch

3. **Backup Important Work**
   - Consider keeping local copies of important specifications
   - Use GitHub's built-in version history as a backup
