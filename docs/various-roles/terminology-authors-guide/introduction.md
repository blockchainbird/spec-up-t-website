# Intro

A terminology author focusses on term definitions covering concepts of the group he/she belongs to. By far the most terminology author will use links to other glossaries, that may or may not be based on Spec-Up-T. They simply copy links and make references in their own text. Which is perfectly fine.

Uses: a text editor. That is the minimal setup. When done he/she publishes the result on the web somewhere as a webpage, for example in `html`.

## Use cases

Besides a simple text editor, a terminology author could use an IDE, git and a browser extension, to edit Spec-Up markdown files for his/her specific context (mental model) in a version managed environment, authenticated, to write the concept and specification and offer this as a PR.

He/she uses browser extensions to check technical consistency of the links in the text and harvests a personal collection of term definitions. Specification author terms that cover those concepts.

These are example uses that we will step-by-step elaborate on.

### A. Use definition

1. Go to the Spec-Up-T glossary, where the definition is listed
2. Copy the persistent URL
3. Paste the persistent URL, save and publish
  - at face value
  - in a link

Why is a Spec-Up-T based glossary interesting to link to? -> version management!

### B. Amend a definition

Follow A.

1. Add text to the definition, save and publish 

How will you maintain this definition? How will you cooperate with others on the definition or a whole list of definitions. Just try to imagine how this play out.

This is why Spec-Up-T came to be.


### C. Create your own terminology using Spec-Up-T

Why Spec-Up-T? -> version management

Follow A. en B. above.

1. Get a git-based version management environment, create a repo there
2. Install Spec-Up-T
3. etc.
