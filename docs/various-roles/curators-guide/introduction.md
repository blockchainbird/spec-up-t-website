:::


Uses an IDE and git and browser extensions to check the overall content of a specification and logical consistency & meaning of term definition in a particular context.

The curator uses browser extensions to harvest a personal collection of term definitions based on those recommended by the specification authors.

A curator can:
Fork a Spec-Up-T repo to his/her user account on GitHub.com
Optionally fetch and merge this repo to an IDE on a local computer.
Configure the user account to publish the GitHub pages generated by Spec-Up-T
Push change to the user account of the curator to show the admin role
Offer a PR with changes and compare them across forks.
