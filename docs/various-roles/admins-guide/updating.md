# Updating

## Updating the Spec-Up-T library

If you installed Spec-Up-T, you probably did so via the installer. This installer uses the Spec-Up-T NPM package via the `node_modules` directory in which Spec-Up-T is installed. To update the package, you can use the standard procedure at the command line:

```bash
npm update
```

## Updating the installation itself

Updating the installation itself requires manually updating files (for now).

An example is manually updating the `package.json,` which contains shortcuts to commands to run Spec-Up-T.
