# Technical introduction

In short, it comes down to this: as a user, you only need to consider the following directories: `spec/` and `docs/`.

## `spec/`

You will place the source files you create yourself in this directory. The format is markdown. Here, you write your content.

## `docs/`

This is the directory where the final `index.html` is created. This file is what you end up consuming as a reader. You will also find a version history here.
