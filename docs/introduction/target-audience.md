## Spec-Up and Spec-Up-<span className="rotate">T</span>

Spec-Up-<span className="rotate">T</span> is based on **Spec-Up**, and some of the content on this website is taken from the [Spec-Up website](https://identity.foundation/spec-up/) and [repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up).

:::tip

If you aren't contributing to an existing Spec-Up-T project and want to create one yourself, you will have to install Spec-Up-T to start using it. Go straight to the [installation section](../getting-started/installation/installation.md) for instructions. If you are contributing to an existing Spec-Up-T project you can contribute to content directly within GitHub's web editor (for example) by editing and adding the appropriate markdown files.
