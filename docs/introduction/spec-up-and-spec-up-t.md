# Spec-Up and Spec-Up-T

Spec-Up-<span className="rotate">T</span> is originated from **Spec-Up**, and some of the content on this website is taken from the [Spec-Up website](https://identity.foundation/spec-up/) and [repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up).

Spec-Up-T is an expansion of DIF's Spec-Up specifically for the needs of the Trust-over-IP foundation. Read more in the elaborate motivation in this technical article: [How it came to be](how-it-came-to-be.md).
