# Troubleshooting

Some tips in case of problems:

## WSL2 users

WSL2 users are recommended to use the `bash` option rather than `PowerShell` in the terminal of Visual Studio Code.

## Use Node.js versions 18+

Spec-Up-T uses `fetch`, which is [added in version 18](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/globals.html#fetch).

Install NVM if you haven't already. (Instructions not given here).

Then run Node.js version 18.
